# il-apr-comparator

This tool takes a pair of cryptocurrencies for a Liquidity Mining Pool on `CakeDefi`. It calculates for a given period of time the Impermanent Loss (IL) of the pool. Then it compares the IL to the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of the liquidity pool and sends a notification to subscribers informing about the difference between IL and APR.
